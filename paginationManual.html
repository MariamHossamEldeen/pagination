        -- What is front-end development?
        Frontend development denotes the realm of web development that concentrates on what the users see on their end. It revolves around changing the code created by backend developers into a graphical interface, making sure that the data is delivered in a simple, easy-to-read format. Without frontend development, all one can see on a website or web application would be some undecipherable codes. Because of frontend developers, people having no background in coding can readily understand and utilize web applications and websites. The thing you see when you visit Canva, Facebook, Google Apps, and other web applications are products of both frontend and backend developers working together.

        --Describe the distinction between Class and Prototypal inheritance in Javascript?
        From most other programming languages, Inheritance in JavaScript is different. JavaScript's object system is prototype-based, not class-based. Objects in JavaScript are just a set of value pairs and a name (key). Talking about inheritance, JavaScript just has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property that includes a link to another object named its prototype.

        -- What is ClickJacking?
        ClickJacking is a security attack where the user is fooled to click on something while they assume they are clicking another thing. The attack mostly happens by the HTML frames. ClickJacking is also regarded as the user interface redressing. It lets the user think that they are utilising a normal UI in the web page, but in actuality, there is an unseen UI in control; you can think of it as the user interface being redressed. When users click on one thing, assuming it to be secure and safe, the hidden UI executes another action.

        --Tell me when and why should I make use of Webpack?
        While creating a complicated front-end application with tons of non-code static possessions, for instance, CSS, fonts, images, etc, then, of course, you should make use of Webpack since it has a lot of amazing benefits.
        If you have a small application that doesn't have a lot of static resources and you only have to create one file of JavaScript to help the customers, then Webpack should be more overhead than needed.
